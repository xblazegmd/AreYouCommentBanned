# Are You Comment Banned?
A simple python program to see if you have been comment banned from GD

# Why?
Since a friend of mine got comment banned, and idk if it's truly a perma ban. So this *should* be able to verify that if it works for them and they want to verify as well.

# DISCLAIMER
I haven't tested neither the windows not linux builds since i'm just too lazy. Plz report any bugs with those builds if they exist, although there should not be any bugs with neither of them.
